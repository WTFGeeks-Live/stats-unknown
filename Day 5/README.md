**Day 5: Poisson Distribution I**<br>

**Task**	<br>
A random variable, X, follows Poisson distribution with mean of 2.5. Find the probability with which the random variable
X is equal to 5.

<br>**Day 5: Poisson Distribution II**<br>

**Task**	<br>
The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy a machine of either type A or type B. For each dayâ€™s operation:

- The number of repairs, X, that machine A needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 0.88. The daily cost of operating A is
C<sub>A</sub> = 160 + 40X<sup>2</sup>
- The number of repairs, Y, that machine B needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 1.55. The daily cost of operating B is
C<sub>B</sub> = 128 + 40Y<sup>2</sup>

Assume that the repairs take a negligible amount of time and the machines are maintained nightly to ensure that they operate
like new at the start of each day. Find and print the expected daily cost for each machine.

<br>**Day 5: Normal Distribution I**<br>

**Task**	<br>
In a certain plant, the time taken to assemble a car is a random variable, X, having a normal distribution with a mean of 20
hours and a standard deviation of 2 hours. What is the probability that a car can be assembled at this plant in:

1. Less than 19.5 hours?
2. Between 20 and 22 hours?
