**Day 4: Binomial Distribution I** <br>

**Task**	<br>
The ratio of boys to girls for babies born in Russia is 1.09:1. If there is 1 child born per birth, what proportion of
Russian families with exactly 6 children will have at least 3 boys?
Write a program to compute the answer using the above parameters. Then print your result, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal
places (i.e., 1.234 format).
