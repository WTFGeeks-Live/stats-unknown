**Day 6: The Central Limit Theorem I**<br>

**Task** <br>
A large elevator can transport a maximum of 9800 pounds. Suppose a load of cargo containing 49 boxes must be transported via the elevator. The box weight of this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of μ = 205 pounds and a standard deviation of σ = 15 pounds. Based on this information, what is the probability that all 49 boxes can be safely loaded into the freight elevator and transported?

<br>**Day 6: The Central Limit Theorem II**<br>

**Task** <br>
The number of tickets purchased by each student for the *University X vs. University Y* football game follows a distribution that has a mean of μ = 2.4 and a standard deviation of σ = 2.0. 

A few hours before the game starts, 100 eager students line up to purchase last-minute tickets. If there are only 250 tickets left, what is the probability that all 100 students will be able to purchase tickets?

<br>**Day 6: The Central Limit Theorem III**<br>

**Task**	<br>
You have a sample of 100 values from a population with mean μ = 500 and with standard deviation σ = 80. Compute the interval that covers the middle 95% of the distribution of the sample mean; in other words, compute A and B such that P(A < x < B) = 0.95. Use the value of z = 1.96. Note that z is the [z-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score)
