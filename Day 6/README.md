**Day 6: The Central Limit Theorem I**<br>

**Task** <br>
A large elevator can transport a maximum of 9800 pounds. Suppose a load of cargo containing 49 boxes must be transported via the elevator. The box weight of this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of μ = 205 pounds and a standard deviation of σ = 15 pounds. Based on this information, what is the probability that all 49 boxes can be safely loaded into the freight elevator and transported?
