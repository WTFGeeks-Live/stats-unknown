**Day 1: Quartiles** <br>

**Task** <br>
Given an array, X, of n integers, calculate the respective first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2), and third quartile (Q3). It is guaranteed that Q1, Q2, and Q3 are integers.

**Day 1: Interquartile Range**

**Task** <br>
The interquartile range of an array is the difference between its first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles (i.e., Q3 - Q1).

Given an array, X, of n integers and an array, F, representing the respective frequencies of X's elements, construct a data set, S, where each x<sub>i</sub> occurs at frequency f<sub>i</sub>. Then calculate and print S's interquartile range, rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format).
