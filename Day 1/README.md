**Day 1: Quartiles**

**Task**
Given an array, X, of n integers, calculate the respective first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2), and third quartile (Q3).
It is guaranteed that Q1, Q2, and Q3 are integers.


**Day 1: Interquartile Range**

**Task**
The interquartile range of an array is the difference between its first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles (i.e., Q3 - Q1).
Given an array, X, of n integers and an array, F, representing the respective frequencies of X's elements, construct a data
set, S, where each x<sub>i</sub> occurs at frequency f<sub>i</sub>. Then calculate and print S's interquartile range, rounded
to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format).


**Day 1: Standard Deviation**

**Task**	
Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the standard deviation. Your answer should be in decimal form, rounded to
a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format). An error margin of + or - 0.1 will be tolerated for the standard deviation.
