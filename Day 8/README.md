<b>Day 8: Least Square Regression Line</b><br>

<b>Task</b><br>
A group of five students enrolls in Statistics immediately after taking a Math aptitude test. Each student's Math aptitude test score,x, and Statistics course grade, y, can be expressed as the following list of (x,y) points:
<br>(95,85)<br>
(85,95)<br>
(80,70)<br>
(70,65)<br>
(60,70)<br>

If a student scored an 80 on the Math aptitude test, what grade would we expect them to achieve in Statistics? Determine the equation of the best-fit line using the least squares method, then compute and print the value of y when x=80.
